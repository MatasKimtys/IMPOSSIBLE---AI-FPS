<h1><u>IMPOSSIBLE</u></h1>
<p>Impossible is a round based aim trainer style game where the targets (enemies) are controlled via a rudimentary AI which we call behaviour profiles. These behaviour profiles can then be developed via the use of a genetic algorithm (GA) to incrementally make each round slightly harder than the round before.</p>

<h1>Controls</h1>

<p>W - Move Forward

A - Move Left

S - Move Back

D - Move Right

Shift - Run

Move Mouse - Aim</p>

Left Click - Shoot

<h1>Credits</h1>
<p>We have made sure to use royalty-free music and sounds (from StoryBlocks - www.storyblocks.com) within the game to be in line with the national and international copyright laws.</p>
<p>During the build of IMPOSSIBLE, we have imported several UNITY publicly-available packages, such as: particle effects pack, Universal RP (for post-processing), TextMeshPRO (for the GUI) and more.</p>
